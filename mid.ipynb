This indicates the rate at which the objective value (expected return) would decrease if the right-hand side of the Energy sector constraint (minimum investment requirement) is increased by one unit (here, one dollar). Since the shadow price is negative, reducing the investment in the Energy sector (loosening the constraint) would increase the expected return. Therefore, it could be worth inquiring about reducing the investment in the Energy sector.\n",

    "Impact of the new return for Coca-Cola Enterprises:\n",
    "If the return for Coca-Cola Enterprises increases to 3.00% and the allowable increase for its return coefficient is 2.4%, the new return is within the allowable increase range. However, without re-solving the model, we cannot definitively say whether the investment in Coca-Cola Enterprises should be increased. The decision would depend on how this change affects the overall portfolio optimization, considering all constraints and the interplay of returns across different investments. Given that the change is within the allowable range, it's unlikely to impact the current optimal solution significantly, but a precise answer would require re-solving the model with the updated return."
